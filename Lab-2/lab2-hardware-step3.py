#   This program prints the barometric pressure and temperature as determined by
#   a TE Connectivity MS5611 barometric presssure sensor connected via I2C. It
#   also calculates the current altitude above sea level.
#
#   All of the work for interfacing with the sensor and doing the related
#   calculations has been encapuslated in a seperate module, ms5611.py.

# Reuse data when calculating altitude so that we don't have to poll the
# sensor twice
